From time to time you need to clean the ears, trim the claws. As for walks and their duration, a leisurely walk can last an hour and a half, but an active run is no longer than fifteen minutes. It is desirable to walk twice a day, but sometimes once will be enough. The temperature indoors or outdoors should be treated very carefully, as severe overheating or hypothermia can be fatal for pugs. This is due to their short coat, which does not protect against the cold. And yet, the inability of the body to effectively remove excess heat. Therefore, in winter you should walk with a pug only in extra clothes, and in summer it is desirable to have air conditioning in the apartment."
